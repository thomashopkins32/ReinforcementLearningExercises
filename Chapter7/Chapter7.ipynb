    "The larger random walk task was most likely used because it would allow for larger $n$ steps to be taken and tested. A smaller walk would most likely shift the value of $n$ down. The change from the left-side end state from $0$ to $-1$ would cause larger $n$ to be more useful since a reward other than $0$ is computed along the $n$-step return if it reaches that terminal state."

    "On-line methods most likely worked better than off-line methods because better estimates for values were used earlier in the learning process. Waiting until the end of the episode delays the ability to use the most up-to-date information. On the other hand, on-line methods allow this new information to be used immediately."

    "The only explanation I can think of is that 3-step returns are particularly noisy for this choice of initialization and number of states in the random walk. So, using a higher learning rate, $\\alpha$, causes the error to increase sharply over the first 10 episodes."
